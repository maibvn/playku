# üì¶ PlayKu Shopify App - Requirements

## üéØ Overview

**PlayKu** is a Shopify embedded app that enhances storefronts selling sound kits, sample packs, or audio-based products. It provides an audio preview experience by integrating a play icon directly on product images and offering a sticky, persistent audio player with waveform visualization and playlist support.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Flow

### Merchant Side (Admin)

- Embedded Remix interface.
- Product table with audio preview management.
- GraphQL used to fetch products and update metafields.
- Audio URLs stored in:
  - Shopify Files or external host
  - App-owned metafield: `namespace: app--{appId}`, `key: audio_url`
  - Local SQL via Prisma

### Storefront Side (Injected Script)

- ScriptTag injects a `playku.js` script into the storefront.
- Script finds all product images and overlays a play icon.
- When clicked:
  - Initializes sticky player and WaveSurfer.
  - Loads product audio.
  - Adds it to the session playlist.
- Sticky player component is appended to `<body>` and persists across page views via `localStorage`.

---

## üß™ Testing & Compatibility

- Test with:
  - Dawn theme
  - At least one third-party popular theme
- Ensure:
  - No DOM clashes with existing theme elements
  - All product audio plays correctly
  - Playlist works and advances automatically

---

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

- Use Shopify CLI with Remix template.
- Ensure `app_proxy` or `script_tag` permissions are included.
- Handle GraphQL metafield permissions explicitly in `shopify.app.toml`.

---

## üìù Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Volume control
- Custom waveform color per theme
- Drag-n-drop playlist sorting
- Support for variants with separate audios
